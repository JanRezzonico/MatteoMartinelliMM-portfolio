                    During my time at the University of Milan (Unimi), I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Computer
                    Science,
                    developing a solid foundation in key areas of the field such as algorithms, data structures,
                    programming,
                    operating systems, and databases. Alongside my studies, I worked full-time,
                    which limited the time I could fully dedicate to university. As a result,
                    I decided to pause my studies to focus on my professional growth and career development.
                    This decision allowed me to gain valuable hands-on experience in software development,
                    which has been instrumental in shaping my technical skills.

                    During this time, I worked on a B2B project for Poste Italiane, collaborating with designers,
                    backend developers,
                    and analysts to find the best solutions. This experience allowed me to work with both legacy and
                    modern approaches to Android development.
                    On the legacy side, I worked with Java, MVC, MVP, SQLite, and Room on devices running older versions
                    of the operating system.
                    On the other hand, I also gained experience with newer technologies such as Android Jetpack, Kotlin,
                    MVVM, LiveData, Room, and Retrofit,
                    working on more innovative solutions. Additionally, I was responsible for implementing both UI and
                    non-UI tests
                    (including unit tests and integration tests), ensuring the quality and reliability of the
                    applications we developed.

                    During this period, I worked on projects for Enel, developing applications both for Android and
                    using Flutter.
                    This experience gave me a comprehensive understanding of the Android operating system, as I had to
                    work at a lower level,
                    utilizing content providers and other system components. As a member of a Scrum team,
                    I was the only developer coordinating directly with the analyst for the implementation of two major
                    projects.
                    This role taught me how to handle large-scale projects independently, requiring strong
                    problem-solving and project management skills.
                    I was involved in the entire development lifecycle, from design and architecture to implementation
                    and testing,
                    gaining valuable experience in working autonomously on complex projects.
